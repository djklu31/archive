		<h1>Handling the Requested XML</h1>

		<h3>Getting the XML from the URL:</h3>
		<p>To get the XML file from the url store in $url, we go the SimpleXML method by calling simplexml_load_file($url);.  <br>
		We set this function to a variable (in our case $xml) and now the xml from the url is stored in a variable.</p>

		<h3>Traversing the XML to retrieve key values:</h3>
		<p>This was the hardest part of my code implementation and may take some trial and error.  Basically, we can to traverse<br>
		 the XML file that we retrieve to obtain key values.  In this stage of our implementation, it is key that we request <br>
		 the number of tab pages and the total count of tabs per page so that we can traverse all of the site pages and add all<br>
		  of the available tabs to our application (this will be relevant later on).  To request the number of site pages in our<br>
		   API, we can set a variable $pagecount to (int)$xml['pages'];.  This code will look in the attributes section of the <br>
		   xml where the value is pages and give us a value converted to an integer.  The same will be done to count.  Again, it<br>
		    is important to get these values because the way that the API is set up is that there are tabs spanned out on multiple<br>
		     pages with a different number of tabs for each page. As a result, we need to save these numbers to traverse all of <br>
		     those pages so that we can obtain all of the tabs from the database.  In addition, the count value is important because<br>
		      at this point, it allows us to specify to the user if any tabs were found or not.  If count is zero, then the user <br>
		      can be notified something along the lines of "No tabs found.".  If tabs are found, we will save all of the different <br>
		      URL's for each page of tabs if necessary.  This will be implemented using a for loop starting at one up to and equal <br>
		      to the last page number retrieved from (int)$xml['pages'].  The for loop will save all of these URL's in an array <br>
		      (in our case called $urlarray[$x]) where the page value will increase by one for every iteration.  The for loop in <br>
		      our case is: for($x=1; $x&lt;=$pagecount; $x++){<br>
    	$urlarray[$x] = "http://app.ultimate-guitar.com/search.php?search_type=title&amp;page=$x&amp;iphone=1&amp;value=$searchvalues";}.</p>
