		<h3>What are Guitar Tabs?</h3>

		<p>Guitar tabs are a way for guitar players to read music through a diagram that <br>
		represents the six strings (assuming the guitar is a standard six string) of a guitar <br>
		and the frets on the particular string to be played.  The six strings are represented <br>
		using a notation signified by a series of dashes: "--------------" the frets to be <br>
		played are signified by numbers.  For example, a 3 on the string to the stop means <br>
		that the third fret on the highest string (thinnest string) should be played.</p>

		<h3>Where is the Guitar Tab Database?</h3>

		<p>For this application, we will use the Ultimate-Guitar database to pull tablature from.<br>
		  There isn't an official API available to the public by this company but it's possible <br>
		  to pull XML files from their iPhone app database and search for artists/songs accordingly.</p>

		<h3>The Procedure:</h3>

		<p>The documentation will first go over creating a simple HTML form to search for artists and <br>
		songs.  We will also go through implementing a way to display the maximum number of tabs chosen <br>
		by the user.  The main meat-and-potatoes of this documentation is the PHP portion.  In this <br>
		portion of the documentation, we will learn how to receive searches from the tab database <br>
		(Ultimate-Guitar "API") and parse the received XML page to embed into our web application. <br>
		Lastly, we will learn how to pull up the actual tab for our guitar playing enjoyment.</p>
