		<h1>Processing Tabs for our Application</h1>

		<h3>Saving all of the Tab Data:</h3>
		<p>Now that we have saved all of our url pages that contain tab data, we will go to each of those url pages to <br>
		pull tab information from.  We will achieve this by loading every page into an xml file like we did earlier, <br>
		keep track of the total number of tabs on each page (different for each page for some odd reason) and sum them <br>
		(we will use this number later on to print out all the tabs using this number as individual indices for an array),<br>
		 and store the values that we want for each tab value on each page by using the (int)$xml['count']; call for each <br>
		 page (whew that was a long sentence).  We will store all of the wanted of each tab in a huge array that will be <br>
		 parsed to output as HTML data later on.  In our example, this is achieved by storing all the data in an array <br>
		 called $storedata[$y] and setting it equal to <br>
		 "&lt;div&gt;   Artist: $artist&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;   Song: $song&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;   Type: $type&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;<br>
		    Version: $version&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;   Tab Rating: $tabrating&lt;/div&gt;";.<br>
		   In addition to storing all the wanted pieces in an array, we will also want to store the individual urls for <br>
		   each tab with the same indices as according to the tab pair in $storedata[$y].  This will allow us to pull <br>
		   the actual tab up for the user after everything is printed. We will go over this in the next section.</p>
