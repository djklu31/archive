A music production iPhone app that will allow users to record multiple loops, store them in banks, and trigger/stop them using a foot controller (using iRig midi interface).  The goals is to introduce a new way of recording and arranging music by triggering loops instead of having to record parts individually thus cutting recording time down by at least half and allowing more creative arrangement possibilities.
