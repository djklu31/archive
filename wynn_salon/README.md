For this project, I created a salon website that was fully responsive with mobile devices and desktop device.  My goal was to make this website as robust as possible with full ability for users to log in to their account, view appointments they made, and delete appointments as needed.  I also am going to use this website for an actual salon in my area, so I kept usability at the forefront of my mind when programming this website.  Admins can log in and view all of the available appointments separated by each stylist and their scheduled appointments accordingly.  I handled user and password validation with an ajax call to processlogin.php which selects username and password from a database and ajax’s errors if found.  If the ajax return is equal to “Login Successful”, then the session is started and the user will be directed to their dashboard page.	The third parties I used for this project were JQuery, Google Maps and Bootstrap.  Inside JQuery, I used the datepicker function for client date selections for their appointments.  Bootstrap handled the front end and the responsive behaviors when the window is stretched around or used on a mobile device.  I also used backstretch to implement a wallpaper in the back of the page.  The contact section has a Google Maps implementation focusing on the address of the salon location.  JQuery was useful for ajax calls in deleting appointments from the database and was also useful for the ajax calls in data validation.
