A website for one of my favorite musical artists: Sun Rai or Rai Thistlethwayne.  
The site contains a management page that allows content to be manipulated: shows can be added through a form,
videos can be added and adjusted without touching the code and bandcamp music can be added or removed as well.

The most current version of the site can be viewed at: web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~luke/sunrai
